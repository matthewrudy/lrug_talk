# The Story
* I was working in Cambridge
* I got an email
* "Come help us...
*  in Hong Kong...
*  immediately"

# So
* I flew over there
* 2 days later

# The Mess
* Started in Groovy and Grails
* Built as a part-time project
* The developer had run away

# The Business
* Targeting SMEs
* *Unsecured* loans
* 'secured against credit card receivables'
* Repaid *daily*

# The App
* Two Phases
* 1. Risk Analysis
* 2. Loan Management

# 1. Risk Analysis
* 6 months financial history
* Statistics
* Trend Analysis
* Sector-wide comparison

# 1. Risk Analysis
## Objective
* Define a "credit limit"

# 2. Loan Management
* From Request to Disbursement
* Daily Direct Debits
* Handle Reversed Payments
* Ongoing Risk Analysis
